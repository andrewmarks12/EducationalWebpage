        <h2 style="text-align: center;">How was the sport created?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The Native American people played
            lacrosse to please "The Creator" a godlike figure that created the game of lacrosse
            as a form of medicine and problem solver for the people. The Natives used lacrosse to
            stay in shape, heal, and fight battles. The game of lacrosse was played on field that were
            miles long by miles wide and the games lasted for days. The games were a way to settle disputes
            in the tribes.
